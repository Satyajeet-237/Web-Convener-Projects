# Web-Convener-Projects
Two projects

PROJECT 1:-

I have learnt the basics of MySQL and PHP . I have also done the Easy part of the first problem(ATTACHED AS Praject_1_basic) that is to print just one entry . I am still trying to print multiple entities .
I have ideas for these ;-
Whatever comes as input update that in MySQL Database and access values from that database for previous registrations but the problem statement said that i should be adding entries at the end one by one which made me think that in that case we might not need MySQL , we can just have an array which is static which could store the values of the entered quantities. Trying for the these methods but keep getting errors.

I just checked that i am not able to make a connection to MySQL from my php basically MySQL is unresponsive to anything i write regarding connections. I will try to write a code but not suer will be able to fix all bugs .(ATTACHED AS Project_1_full)

BENEFITS OF PROJECT :
Learned a lot in a week's time: Basic syntax of both MySQL and PHP .


PROJECT 2:- 
Using Angular and it feels very good to use.
First project on single component attached .

BENEFITS OF PROJECT: Saw the first glimpse of app making(my dream)
