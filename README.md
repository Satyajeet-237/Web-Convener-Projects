Two projects


I have learnt the basics of MySQL and PHP . I have also done the Easy part of the first problem that is to print just one entry . I am still trying to print multiple entities .
I have ideas for these ;-
Whatever comes as input update that in MySQL Database and access values from that database for previous registrations but the problem statement said that i should be adding entries at the end one by one which made me think that in that case we might not need MySQL , we can just have an array which is static which could store the values of the entered quantities. Trying for the these methods but keep getting errors.
